# Enterprise Network Design and Troubleshooting

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience in designing and troubleshooting a small enterprise network
using Cisco Packet Tracer. The focus is on network connectivity, IP addressing, VLAN configuration,
routing, and secure remote access.

The project is based on two real-world style scenarios:
- Fixing a misconfigured network to restore connectivity
- Designing and configuring a secure and scalable network for multiple departments

## Scenario 1: Network Troubleshooting
In this scenario, I worked with a misconfigured network and identified multiple connectivity issues.
I analysed the network step by step and resolved the problems by correcting configurations at different
layers of the network.

Key tasks included:
- Identifying subnet and VLAN mismatches
- Fixing trunk and access port configuration issues
- Resolving routing and interface configuration problems
- Verifying connectivity using ping and traceroute

## Scenario 2: Network Design
In this scenario, I designed and built a small enterprise network for two departments (HR and Finance)
with a single Internet connection. The design focused on scalability, security, and reliability.

Key tasks included:
- Planning IP addressing with future expansion in mind
- Configuring routers and switches
- Implementing VLAN segmentation between departments
- Securing network devices with passwords and encryption
- Enabling remote management using SSH and Telnet

## Validation and Testing
- Verified end-to-end connectivity between network devices
- Tested inter-department communication
- Confirmed secure remote access to network devices

## Tools and Technologies
- TCP/IP networking
- Subnetting and IP addressing
- VLAN and trunking
- Routing and switching
- Network troubleshooting techniques
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## What I Learned
- How to systematically troubleshoot network connectivity issues
- The importance of proper IP planning and network segmentation
- How network security and remote access are implemented at the device level
- How scalable network design supports future growth
